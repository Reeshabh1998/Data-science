Haven't used the pattern or fingerprint reader once the face recognition was set up.I don't mind the notch coz of this feature.2) Accurate and blazing fast fingerprint reader.3) Best gesture based system. Period.. Way better than vanilla Android Pie. Better than iOS and OnePlus 6.4) Poco launcher makes life easier on a Xiaomi Android device.5) MIUI pie system takes 8.55 GB. Compared to the Android one Xiaomi Mi A2, whose Android Pie takes a whopping 13 GB of space.6) The feel of heft added balances the polycarbonate back compared to metal or glass.7) Not slippery. Only flagship phone that can be used without a case.8) Battery life on par with other flagships.Dislikes1) ugly notch.2) Like all MIUI , Ads are present from the usual pre installed apps.
